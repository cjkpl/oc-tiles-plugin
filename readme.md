# Tiles Factory

An OctoberCMS plugin for easy creation and usage of cards (tiles). The plugin supports 'out of the box' the TailwindCSS-based cards format used by [FateFactory](https://fatefactory.com?target=_blank), so that you can use FF's visual card browser, pick your favourite card, and use it in your website.

Plugin contains both component and snippet for use either in 'CMS' pages or 'Static Pages'.
